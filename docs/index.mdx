# skrt
> A React/MDX static site generator (SSG) with launch control

## About

`skrt` is a command-line tool used to build static HTML websites with minimal
effort. It's really well-suited for building documentation sites but is
flexible enough to build other kinds of static sites like blogs or portfolios as
well. It was heavily-inspired by [Charge][chargeUrl].

## Features

* Generate static HTML using [React][reactUrl]/[MDX][mdxUrl]
* Easy-to-use layout system using custom or built-in layouts
* Smart metadata system (e.g. page title, description, slug) to simplify
  generating a complete website
* Watch mode that automatically rebuilds/refreshes for development using
  [Browsersync][bsUrl]
* And yes, it's fast, skrt! skrt!

## Quick Start

1. Install skrt: `yarn add @generates/skrt ‚Äîdev`
2. Create a `docs` directory with an `index.mdx` file containing the documentation index.
3. Add the build command as a script to your `package.json`:

    ```json
    ‚Äúdocs‚Äù: ‚Äúskrt build docs site‚Äù
    ```

    And run it with:

    ```console
    yarn docs
    ```

    Or run it manually:

    ```console
    yarn skrt build docs site
    ```

4. During development, run it in `watch` mode:

    ```console
    yarn docs -w
    ```

## CLI Commands

- `build` - Build the site from source
- `watch` - Build the site each time a source file chnages
