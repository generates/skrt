# skrt
> A React/MDX static site generator (SSG) with launch control

## About

`skrt` is a command-line tool used to build static HTML websites with minimal
effort. It's really well-suited for building documentation sites but is
flexible enough to build other kinds of static sites like blogs or portfolios as
well. It was heavily-inspired by [Charge][chargeUrl].

## Features

* Generate static HTML using [React][reactUrl]/[MDX][mdxUrl]
* Easy-to-use layout system using custom or built-in layouts
* Smart metadata system (e.g. page title, description, slug) to simplify
  generating a complete website
* Watch mode that automatically rebuilds/refreshes for development using
  [Browsersync][bsUrl]
* And yes, it's fast, skrt! skrt!
